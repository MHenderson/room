A graph $G(V,E)$ consists of two sets.
The first $V$, is called the vertex-set, while the other $E$ consists of unordered pairs of $V$ and is called the edge set.
Usually graphs are represented with diagrams where the members of $V$ are drawn as points and the members of $E$ as lines connecting points.
Adjacency for two vertices means being connected by an edge.
The \emph{complete graph} $K_n$ is the graph on $n$ vertices in which all distinct vertices are adjacent.
