In 1850 Thomas Penyngton Kirkman, an English mathematician from Bolton, published the following problem in \emph{The Lady’s and Gentleman’s Diary}.

\begin{quotation}
Fifteen young ladies of a school walk out three abreast for seven days in succession: it is required to arrange them daily so that no two shall walk abreast more than once.
\end{quotation}

In solving this problem Kirkman discovered the following square array, which he observed was a ``very curious arrangement''.

\begin{equation}
  \begin{bmatrix}
       &    &    & hi & kl & mn & op \\
       & il & mo &    & np & hk &    \\
       & no & hl & mp &    &    & ik \\
    lp &    & in & ko & hm &    &    \\
    im &    & kp &    &    & lo & hn \\
    ho & km &    & ln &    & ip &    \\
    kn & hp &    &    & io &    & lm 
  \end{bmatrix}
  \label{eq:roomsquare}
\end{equation}

The curiosity of this square is that each of the letters
$h, i, k, l, m, n, o, p$
occurs precisely once in every column and row, while in the entire square each of the letters makes a pair with every other letter exactly once.
Kirkman was able to employ this square to solve his Schoolgirl Problem.
To each pair in the first column he added the element 1, to each pair in the second column 2 and so on.
In addition he introduced the missing triple of numbers to each row.
(e.g. row one has no elements in any of the first three columns so the numbers 1,2 and 3 would not appear hence he would add the triple 123).
The seven rows of unique triples then corresponded to seven days in which the elements, corresponding to schoolgirls, were paired together exactly once throughout the arrangement.
Thereby solving the problem.

Kirkman was a notable mathematician who is often regarded as the originator of the object in \eqref{eq:roomsquare}, which has subsequently become known as a \inlinedef{Room square} (after T.G. Room).
