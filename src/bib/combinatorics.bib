  abstract = {We present a new type of tournament design that we call a complete mixed doubles round robin tournament, CMDRR(n,k), that generalizes spouse-avoiding mixed doubles round robin tournaments and strict Mitchell mixed doubles round robin tournaments. We show that CMDRR(n,k) exist for all allowed values of n and k apart from 4 exceptions and 31 possible exceptions. We show that a fully resolvable CMDRR(2n,0) exists for all n \$\textbackslash ge\$ 5 and a fully resolvable CMDRR(3n,n) exists for all n \$\textbackslash ge\$ 5 and n odd. We prove a product theorem for constructing CMDRR(n,k).},

  abstract = {Combinatorics is a subject of increasing importance, owing to its links with computer science, statistics and algebra. This is a textbook aimed at second-year undergraduates to beginning graduates. It stresses common techniques (such as generating functions and recursive construction) which underlie the great variety of subject matter and also stresses the fact that a constructive or algorithmic proof is more valuable than an existence proof. The book is divided into two parts, the second at a higher level and with a wider range than the first. Historical notes are included which give a wider perspective on the subject. More advanced topics are given as projects and there are a number of exercises, some with solutions given.},
