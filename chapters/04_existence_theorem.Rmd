\begin{theorem}
There exists a Room square of side $v$, where $v$
is a positive integer different from 3 or 5.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
A Room square of side 1 exists trivially.

Any positive integer can be rewritten in the form:

\begin{equation}
v = 3^{a}5^{b}n
\end{equation}

where $n$ is relatively prime to 15, i.e.
$(15, n) = 1$.

Suppose that $a + b = 0$, then a Room square exists
due to XXX, XXX, XXX, XXX and XXX.

For $a + b = 1$, then either $v = 3n$ or $v = 5n$.
In both cases, provided $v > 5$, XXX guarantees the
existence of a Room square of side $v$.

Now conside $a + b = 2$. There are three cases.

1. $v = 3\cdot 5\cdot n$
2. $v = 3^{2}n$
3. $v = 5^{2}n$

In all cases, a Room square exists by XXX, provided
that Room squares of side 9, 15 and 25 all exist. A
Room square of side 25 exists by XXX and Room squares
of side 9 and 15 were constructed in XXX. For examples
of Room squares of orders 10 and 16 see, respectively,
XXXX and XXX.

Greater values of $a + b$ follow by induction since if
$a + b \geq 3$, where $t = 3^{c}5^{d}n$ and
$c + d \geq 2$, and in both cases applying XXX will
provide a square of side $v$ given one of side $t$.
